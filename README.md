# Dual-Mode-Stopwatch
Project Title:
Stopwatch with Dual Mode (Increment and Countdown) Using ATmega32 and Seven-Segment Display.

Objective:
Design and implement a digital stopwatch with two operational modes:
counting up (increment mode) and counting down (countdown mode).
The project utilizes an ATmega32 microcontroller, six multiplexed seven-segment displays (common anode), and multiple push buttons for user interaction.

Project Overview:
This project involves creating a versatile stopwatch that operates in two distinct modes:
1. Increment Mode (Default): The stopwatch counts upwards from zero, displaying hours, minutes, and seconds on six seven-segment displays.
2. Countdown Mode: The stopwatch counts downwards from a user-defined time, functioning as a countdown timer.

Features:
• Reset: Resets the time to zero in both modes.
• Pause: Pauses the time counting, allowing the stopwatch to hold its current value.
• Resume: Resumes counting from the paused time.
• Mode Toggle: Switches between increment and countdown modes.
